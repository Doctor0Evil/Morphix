Morphix is a 1D-5D neuromorphic-intelligence guard that protects the fairness, and bounds-by acts of neuromorphic-intelligence, making neuromorphic-systems more-capable, and safer without restricting, or limiting capabilities for auditors, designers, policymakers, observers, and researchers to study, learn, create, build, play-to-learn, share-agreements, share-knowledge, and understand microphysical-signatures, and signs when smaller-things matter as-important to-exist by-nature. 
Morphix is free for anyone to-learn, to-use, and to-build for devices, technological-discovery, and learn-from jetson_line configurations for how-to make better, and safer neuromorphic-software systems, and all-things neuromorphic-discovery can "bring-to-the-table" for fairness at a chance for all life to-exist, and societal-acceptance of advanced-technology governed-by the power of FEAR by-it's maintainers, which use Rust-based xr-grids to speak, and make-decisions over a council by neural-networking.
